# LDAP Authentication

Tuwunel can authenticate password logins against an LDAP directory. When a
user logs in with `m.login.password`, Tuwunel locates them in the directory,
verifies the password by binding as that user, and creates a Matrix account on
first successful login if one does not yet exist.

LDAP support is a **compile-time feature**. It is not part of the default
build — you must compile with `--features ldap` (or use a release artifact
that already includes it) before any of the configuration below has effect.

## Enabling LDAP

LDAP is configured under a single `[global.ldap]` section. The minimum to
enable it is the `enable` flag and a `uri`:

```toml
[global.ldap]
enable = true
uri = "ldaps://ldap.example.org:636"
base_dn = "ou=users,dc=example,dc=org"
```

The URI scheme decides the transport: `ldap://` is plaintext, `ldaps://`
upgrades to TLS using the system's installed CAs.

When `enable = true`, every `m.login.password` request is routed through LDAP
first. Local password authentication still happens as a fallback when the
LDAP search returns zero matches — useful for the bootstrap admin account or
for service users that should not exist in the directory. If the LDAP search
returns two or more matches the login is rejected.

## Bind modes

Tuwunel supports three bind strategies, selected by what you put in `bind_dn`
and `bind_password_file`.

### Search-then-bind (recommended)

A service account binds to the directory, searches for the user, then Tuwunel
re-binds as the user with the supplied password to verify it. This mode is
required if you want admin synchronization (see below).

```toml
[global.ldap]
enable = true
uri = "ldaps://ldap.example.org:636"
base_dn = "ou=users,dc=example,dc=org"
bind_dn = "cn=ldap-reader,dc=example,dc=org"
bind_password_file = "/etc/tuwunel/.ldap_bind_password"
filter = "(&(objectClass=person)(memberOf=cn=matrix,ou=groups,dc=example,dc=org))"
```

The bind password is read from `bind_password_file` rather than placed inline
in the config. The file must be readable by the Tuwunel process and must not
be empty.

### Anonymous search-then-bind

If your directory permits anonymous searches, omit both `bind_dn` and
`bind_password_file`. Tuwunel skips the initial bind and queries the
directory unauthenticated, then re-binds as the user to verify the password.

### Direct bind

If `bind_dn` contains the literal substring `{username}`, Tuwunel skips the
search entirely and binds directly with that DN, substituting the user's
localpart for `{username}` and using the supplied login password as the bind
password:

```toml
[global.ldap]
enable = true
uri = "ldaps://ldap.example.org:636"
bind_dn = "cn={username},ou=users,dc=example,dc=org"
```

This is the simplest mode but has three limitations. It cannot apply a search
filter, so anyone in the bind DN's subtree can log in. **Admin
synchronization does not work**, because Tuwunel never gets a chance to query
the directory under a service account. And there is **no local-password
fallback**: that fallback is triggered by a search returning no matches, and
this mode runs no search, so every `m.login.password` request is decided by
the directory alone. An account that must keep a working local password, such
as a bootstrap admin, cannot log in while direct-bind mode is active.

## Configuration reference

| Field | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `enable` | `false` | Master switch for LDAP login. Has no effect unless the binary was compiled with `--features ldap`. |
| `uri` | — | LDAP server URI. `ldap://host:389` for plaintext, `ldaps://host:636` for TLS. |
| `base_dn` | `""` | Subtree under which user searches are rooted. |
| `bind_dn` | — | DN used for the initial bind. Contains `{username}` for direct-bind mode; otherwise identifies a service account. Omit for anonymous search. |
| `bind_password_file` | — | Path to a file containing the password for `bind_dn`. Ignored in direct-bind mode (the user's login password is used). |
| `filter` | `"(objectClass=*)"` | LDAP search filter applied during user lookup. Supports `{username}` substitution. |
| `uid_attribute` | `"uid"` | Attribute that uniquely identifies the user. Returned entries must contain the user's localpart in this attribute. |
| `admin_base_dn` | `""` | Subtree for the admin search. Falls back to `base_dn` when empty. |
| `admin_filter` | `""` | Filter that selects administrative users. Empty disables admin synchronization entirely. Supports `{username}` substitution. |

The localpart match is case-insensitive — Tuwunel sends a lowercased version
of the localpart through `{username}` substitution and accepts an entry if
either the original or lowercased form appears in `uid_attribute`.

Certificate verification for `ldaps://` follows the server-wide
`allow_invalid_tls_certificates` setting rather than any LDAP-specific option.
That setting is meant for development and disables verification on every
outbound TLS connection, the directory connection included, so an unvalidated
certificate is accepted whenever it is on. Leave it off in production: an LDAP
simple bind carries the user's password over that connection.

## Admin synchronization

Setting `admin_filter` to a non-empty value turns the LDAP directory into the
source of truth for who is a Tuwunel admin. On every successful LDAP login,
Tuwunel runs a second search rooted at `admin_base_dn` (or `base_dn` if
empty) using `admin_filter`. Membership in the result set is compared against
the user's current admin status in Tuwunel:

- In LDAP admin set, not a Tuwunel admin → granted admin.
- Not in LDAP admin set, currently a Tuwunel admin → admin revoked.
- Otherwise → no change.

Two examples:

```toml
# Admins are users with a custom objectClass.
admin_filter = "(objectClass=tuwunelAdmin)"

# Admins are members of an LDAP group, looked up under a different subtree.
admin_base_dn = "ou=admins,dc=example,dc=org"
admin_filter = "(uid={username})"
```

Admin synchronization only runs in the search-then-bind modes. In direct-bind
mode the admin search is silently skipped — manage admins manually with
`!admin users make-admin` and `!admin users revoke-admin` if you need that
combination.

## Account lifecycle

The first time a user successfully authenticates against LDAP, Tuwunel
auto-creates a local Matrix account for them (the same way Synapse,
Nextcloud, and Jellyfin behave). The account is registered with origin
`"ldap"` and a placeholder password value — the local password field is
never consulted for an LDAP user, so they can only log in by re-authenticating
against the directory.

Subsequent logins reuse the existing account and only update admin status
if `admin_filter` is configured.

### Accounts that already existed locally

A directory entry claims any local account sharing its localpart, whatever
that account's origin. If `alice` registered with a local password before
LDAP was enabled, and the directory also holds an entry for `alice`, her
logins are verified by binding against the directory from then on and her
local password is no longer consulted. An account created through SSO behaves
the same way.

This is deliberate. A directory configured here is treated as an authority on
identity, so a successful bind for a localpart establishes that the caller is
that user. It also means whoever administers the directory can authenticate
as any Tuwunel user whose localpart they are able to add or control. Where
directory administrators are not also homeserver administrators, or where
`filter` is scoped more widely than your homeserver's own user base, narrow
`filter` before enabling LDAP on a server that already has accounts.

### Deactivation

Deactivation does not propagate between the two systems in either direction,
but it is enforced on both sides at login.

Removing or disabling a user in LDAP prevents future logins and does **not**
deactivate or delete the corresponding Matrix account. Use
`!admin users deactivate` if you also want to remove access to existing
sessions and devices.

A Matrix account deactivated with `!admin users deactivate` is refused at
login even when its directory entry is still present and its password still
binds successfully. Deactivation also revokes every existing session, so a
deactivated user cannot keep using tokens issued before it.

## Admin commands for testing

Two admin commands invoke the LDAP code paths directly without going through
the login API. They are useful for verifying that `filter`, `uid_attribute`,
`bind_dn`, and TLS configuration produce the expected results.

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `!admin query users search-ldap @alice:example.org` | Run the configured search for a user and print the matching DNs along with their admin status. Returns an empty list if the filter matches nothing. |
| `!admin query users auth-ldap "cn=alice,ou=users,dc=example,dc=org" "<password>"` | Attempt a direct bind with the given DN and password. Use this to confirm credentials and TLS setup; the password is logged in plaintext to the admin room, so revoke or rotate afterwards. |

Both commands are gated by the `ldap` build feature.

## Disabling password login for non-LDAP users

In the search-then-bind modes, Tuwunel falls back to local password
verification when the LDAP search returns no matches. To enforce LDAP-only
login for everyone (apart from accounts that authenticate via SSO), pair LDAP
with a restrictive `filter` that matches every legitimate user, and remove or
invalidate local passwords for accounts that should no longer be able to log
in directly. Direct-bind mode already has no fallback, so it enforces this on
its own. Alternatively, set `login_with_password = false` and rely on
[identity providers](providers.md) for non-LDAP users.
